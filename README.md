# `COM316` - **Artificial Intelligence**

## :eyes: About

Repo for all the code of `COM 316` - Artificial Intelligence. Dunno why it has to be `Scheme` but it's been fun :shrug: 

- **Instructor**: [Prof. Garry Parker](https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/) - Spring '23

## :wrench: How to compile?

> Had a hard time figuring out how to compile `Scheme`... Currently using [`CHICKEN`](http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Getting%20started#installing-chicken). 

### [`CHICKEN`](http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Getting%20started#installing-chicken) :chicken:

Compiling a file

```bash
$ csi -s <path-to-file>.scm
```

### [`ChezScheme`](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/)

Haven't tried yet but got suggested to use this.
